   * (andyk) investigate exploding loss

ex: 4.32167
mean loss: 0.00023
................................................................

   * (andyk) actually mask out invalid actions instead of trying to get the NN to assign 0 probability to them.

Low priority:

   * (andyk) average_sigma currently stores a reference, this will cause bugs if you keep
     a reference to the sigma without a reference to the underlying tree, maybe a
     shared pointer should be used? I don't really want to copy the tree into the
     strategy...

   * (andyk) Add code to give names to actions

   * (andyk) Make code to generically play a game

# Low priority:

   * (andyk) Add code to give names to actions

   * (andyk) Make code to generically play a game

# Done:

   * DONE (andyk) investigate reweighting

   * DONE (andyk) investigate average targeting ratios not falling
     below delta

   * DONE (andyk) convert targeting to use an exponential moving
     average to remove boundary effects at round changes

   * DONE (andyk) average_sigma currently stores a reference, this
     will cause bugs if you keep a reference to the sigma without a
     reference to the underlying tree, maybe a shared pointer should
     be used? I don't really want to copy the tree into the
     strategy...

   * DONE (andyk) actually mask out invalid actions instead of trying to
     get the NN to assign 0 probability to them.

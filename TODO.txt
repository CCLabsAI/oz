Low priority:

* average_sigma currently stores a reference, this will cause bugs if you keep
  a reference to the sigma without a reference to the underlying tree, maybe a
  shared pointer should be used? I don't really want to copy the tree into the
  strategy...

* Add code to give names to actions

* Make code to generically play a game
